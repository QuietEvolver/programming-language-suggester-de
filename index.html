        <strong><em>Go: Like watermelon!</em></strong>
        Go (also called Golang or Go language) is an open source programming language used for general purpose. Go was developed by Google engineers to create dependable and efficient software. Most similarly modeled after C, Go is statically typed and explicit. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

      <p id="language-2" class="hidden">
        <strong><em>Python: Like snow!</em></strong> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

        <strong><em>Rust: Like cats</em></strong> Rust is a low-level programming language with direct access to hardware and memory, which makes it a great solution for embedded and bare-metal development. You can use Rust to write operation systems or microcontroller applications. High performance and safety are the features that made Rust so appealing to scientists that started using it to perform heavy data analysis. Rust is blazingly fast, making it an ideal choice for computational biology and machine learning, where you need to process large amounts of data very quickly.
